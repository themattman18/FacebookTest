            I am conducting a test to show people how to protect their password online. There are a few steps you can take to make you don't get hacked

            <ol>
                <li>Always check the url.  If you notice the url of the page you can see that it's not facebook.com.  A lot of the time, the url will be close to the real thing but will have some spelling mistakes in it</li>
                <li>Do not go to a website by clicking on links included in emails or social media messages.</li>
                <li>If the message sounds weird, it probably is.  No one wants to give you money, show you weird pictures, or get help with their relationships troubles</li>
            </ol>

            If you follow me on instagram you can see a video in my stoires to see how I did this
